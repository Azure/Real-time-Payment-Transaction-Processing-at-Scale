## Deployment choices

The following table summarizes the deployment choices available for the solution:

 Deployment type | Description | When to use
--- | --- | ---
[Cloud Shell](./deployment-cloudshell.md) | Use Azure Cloud Shell to deploy the solution to your Azure subscription. | Best suited for quick deployment. All you need is an Azure subscription and a browser.
[Azure VM](./deployment-azurevm.md) | Use an Azure VM to deploy the solution to your Azure subscription. | Best suited for situations where you need the flexibility of a full development environment (e.g. to customize the solution) but you don't have a local development environment available.
[Standard](./deployment-standard.md) | Use your local development environment to deploy the solution to your Azure subscription. | Best suited for situations where you need the flexibility of a full development environment (e.g. to customize the solution) and you have a local development environment available.
